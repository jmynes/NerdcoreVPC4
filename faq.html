              <section id="one">
                <h2>Q: Can the producer sing/rap on the hook?</h2>
                A: Yes.  As long as the lyrics/melody are developed by the vocalist the producer CAN sing/rap on the hook, however, there must be strong (50% or more) representation of the vocalist on the hook (unless otherwise stated on the round challenge)
              </section>
            
              <section id="two">
                <h2>Q: Can we have more than 2 team members?  Can it be one member that produces AND raps?</h2>
                A: No.
              </section>
            
              <section id="three">
                <h2>Q: What about sample hooks?</h2>
                A: Sample hooks are allowed.  (unless otherwise stated on the round challenge)
              </section>
            
              <section id="four">
                <h2>Q: Do samples have to be cleared?</h2>
                A: No, they do not.
              </section>
            
              <section id="five">
                <h2>Q: Can we do covers?</h2>

              </section>
            
              <section id="six">   
                <h2>Q: Am I disqualified if I miss a round?</h2>
                A: No, in fact you are encouraged to keep going which is why we have initiated “best of round” prizes for the highest scoring team on each round.
              </section>
            
              <section id="seven">
              <h2>Q: What if two teams have the same exact score?</h2>
                A: In that event the fan vote will be the tie-breaker.  Whichever received the higher score from the fan vote will be considered the winner of that round.  In the event that a tie is still in place, there will be a sudden death (48 hour) tie breaker round.
              </section>

              <section id="one">

              <section id="two">
                <h2>Q: Are their lyrical/subject constrictions?</h2>
                A: No, there are not.  However, understand that you are submitting this track publically.  Please use personal digression regarding hate speech, offensive subject matter, etc.  These will not get you disqualified, but unpopular topics such as racism and homophobia are not likely to score high within the community.
              </section>
            
              <section id="three">
                <h2>Q: Do all tracks have to have rapping in them?</h2>
                A: No, as long as there is a single vocalist and a single producer, a track can also be purely melodic singing if you like.  However, this still has to fall into the guidelines for track submission, meet the specific challenge of the round.
