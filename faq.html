              <h1>FAQ</h1>

              <h2>Q: Can the producer sing/rap on the hook?</h2>
              <p>
                A: Yes.  As long as the lyrics/melody are developed by the vocalist the producer CAN sing/rap on the hook, however, there must be strong (50% or more) representation of the vocalist on the hook (unless otherwise stated on the round challenge)
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Can we have more than 2 team members?  Can it be one member that produces AND raps?</h2>
              <p>
                A: No.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: What about sample hooks?</h2>
              <p>
                A: Sample hooks are allowed.  (unless otherwise stated on the round challenge)
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Do samples have to be cleared?</h2>
              <p>
                A: No, they do not.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Q: Can we do covers?</h2>
              <p>
                A: No.  (unless otherwise stated on the round challenge)
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Am I disqualified if I miss a round?</h2>
              <p>   
                A: No, in fact you are encouraged to keep going which is why we have initiated “best of round” prizes for the highest scoring team on each round.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: What if two teams have the same exact score?</h2>
              <p>
                A: In that event the fan vote will be the tie-breaker.  Whichever received the higher score from the fan vote will be considered the winner of that round.  In the event that a tie is still in place, there will be a sudden death (48 hour) tie breaker round.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: How long will it take for the results to come in on the final winners?</h2>
              <p>
                A: The same time as the final round 5 scores are released.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Will you repeat challenges from prior years?</h2>
              <p>
                A: Aspects of prior year challenges may appear in the round challenges.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Will there be a guest vocalist challenge?</h2>
              <p>
                A: Yes.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Will there be eliminations?</h2>
              <p>
                A: No.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Do I have to announce my team officially?</h2>
              <p>   
                A: No.  Your first round submission can be your team announcement.  Make sure to follow track submission guidelines.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Are the judges or organizers getting paid for this?</h2>
              <p>
                A: Absolutely not.  The judges, administrators, and support teams are volunteering their time for this competition and are not eligible to compete or receive any compensation for their participation in this competition.  Any sponsorship money, prizes, or gifts will be invested in the promotion and rewards of the VPC event, websites, and social media.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Is there an entry fee?</h2>
              <p>
                A: No.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: What if I have other questions?  Where should I ask?</h2>
              <p>
                A: Please submit all questions via email to NerdcoreVPC@gmail.com.  There is no guarantee that the facebook will be answered in a timely manner.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Are their lyrical/subject constrictions?</h2>
              <p>
                A: No, there are not.  However, understand that you are submitting this track publically.  Please use personal digression regarding hate speech, offensive subject matter, etc.  These will not get you disqualified, but unpopular topics such as racism and homophobia are not likely to score high within the community.
              </p>

              <h2>Q: Do all tracks have to have rapping in them?</h2>
              <p>
                A: No, as long as there is a single vocalist and a single producer, a track can also be purely melodic singing if you like.  However, this still has to fall into the guidelines for track submission, meet the specific challenge of the round.
